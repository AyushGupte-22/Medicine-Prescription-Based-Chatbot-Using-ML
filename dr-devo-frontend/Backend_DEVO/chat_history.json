This condition is caused by an allergic reaction to airborne substances, such as pollen, dust mites, or pet dander.\n\nTo help manage your symptoms, here are some precautions you can take:\n\n1. Avoid exposure to allergens as much as possible. This may mean staying indoors during peak pollen hours, using air filters, and washing bedding frequently.\n2. Over-the-counter medications can help alleviate symptoms. Antihistamines, decongestants, and nasal sprays are common treatments.\n3. Allergy shots (immunotherapy) may be recommended for severe cases. These involve receiving regular injections of small amounts of the allergen to build up immunity over time.\n4. Saline nasal sprays can help keep your nasal passages moist and clear.\n5. Avoid smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke, as this can worsen symptoms.\n6.

Here are some steps you can take:\n\n1. Avoid rubbing your eye as it can worsen the redness and potentially spread any infection.\n2. Wash your hands thoroughly before touching your eye or the surrounding area.\n3. Use a clean, soft cloth to gently pat the area around your eye if it feels irritated.\n4. If the redness persists for more than a day or two, or if you experience pain, blurred vision, or discharge, it is recommended to consult a healthcare professional.\n5. If you wear contact lenses, avoid wearing them until the redness subsides.\n6. If you know the cause of the redness (e.g., exposure to allergens), try to avoid that trigger if possible.\n7. Over-the-counter artificial tears or eye drops may help soothe the eye, but consult a healthcare professional before using them, especially if you have any underlying eye conditions.\n8. If you have been exposed to someone with an eye infection, or if you suspect an infection, do not share personal items such as towels, washcloths, or makeup with others.\n9. If you wear makeup, make sure to clean your makeup brushes and applicators regularly to prevent the spread of bacteria.\n10. If you work in a dusty or smoky environment, wear protective eyewear to prevent irritants from reaching your eyes.\n\nIf the redness persists or worsens, consult a healthcare professional for further evaluation and treatment.\n**Context:** None"

For severe cases, hospitalization may be necessary for intravenous antibiotics.
